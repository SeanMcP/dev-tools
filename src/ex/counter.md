<div id="counter">
    <button data-decrement>-1</button>
    <input type="number" value="0" name="count">
    <button data-increment>+1</button>
</div>

You can increase and decrease the count with the "+1" and "-1" buttons, respectively, or enter a number directly into the input.

<summary><b>Exercise</b></summary>

There is a bug when you enter a value into the input that is not a number.

Use the debugger to find out where the problem is occurring and why.
